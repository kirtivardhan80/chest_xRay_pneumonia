## 🧠 Project Overview

Chest X-rays are a crucial diagnostic tool for pneumonia, but manual diagnosis can be slow and prone to error. In this project, we:

- Built a CNN to classify chest X-rays
- Trained the model on publicly available medical data
- Evaluated its performance with various metrics
- Visualized predictions and deployed a testing pipeline

## 📦 Dataset

We used the **Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia)** dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia).  
It includes:

- `train/` — for model training  
- `test/` — for final evaluation  
- `val/` — optional, for validation

---

## 🧪 Model Summary

- **Input Shape**: (220, 220, 3)  
- **Architecture**: Custom CNN with Conv2D, MaxPooling, Dropout, Flatten, and Dense layers  
- **Output**: Binary classification (`Normal` or `Pneumonia`)  
- **Loss Function**: Binary Crossentropy  
- **Optimizer**: Adam

---

## 🔍 Evaluation Metrics

- Accuracy  
- Precision / Recall / F1-score  
- Confusion Matrix  
- ROC-AUC Curve  

The model achieved **over 90% validation accuracy** during training.  
Note: Accuracy may vary depending on training epochs, augmentation, and batch size.

## 🚫 Model File Note

Due to GitHub's 100MB file limit, the trained model `.h5` is **not included** here.

If you'd like to test without retraining, download the model from Google Drive:

📥 [Download chest_xray_pneumonia_model.h5](https://drive.google.com/file/d/YOUR_MODEL_ID/view?usp=sharing)

After downloading, place the file inside the project folder.
